# oop345_Workshops
This repository contains my C++ projects and assignments from the OOP345 course. It covers object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and file handling. Each workshop demonstrates practical applications of these principles. Clone this repo to explore my work and run the projects locally.
